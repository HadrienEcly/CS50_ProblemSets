## Introduction  
This repository contains my take to the challenges from **Harvard's: Introduction to Computer Science**. This is an intensive introduction to computer science that covers fundamental programming concepts, algorithms, and data structures using languages like **C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript**.  

Below, you will find an organized list of all the problem sets, each with its respective exercises that i did between january and march 2025

## 01 - Basics of the language C 
<details>
<summary>Hello, Hello Name, Mario, Credit</summary>

- **Hello** – Famous Basic C program that prints "hello, world."
