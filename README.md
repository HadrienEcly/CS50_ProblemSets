# üë®‚Äçüíª Problem sets collection

## Introduction  
This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from **Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science**. CS50 is an intensive introduction to computer science that covers fundamental programming concepts, algorithms, and data structures using languages like **C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript**.  

Each problem set challenges students with practical programming tasks that reinforce computational thinking and problem-solving skills. Below, you will find an organized list of all the problem sets, each with its respective exercises that i did between january and march 2025
