Their aura is danceable and energetic (Most average 0.45 for energy and 0.71 for dance)
This might not be representative because top 100 songs is a lot and not really representatif of a mood. Maybe make the average of aura based on the songs listened for the longest time instead of time played, it can fluctuate depending on the month so you could do an aura/per month
